# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The first player to align three of their symbols (either X or O) vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw
